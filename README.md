## Developer Notes - JOHN ERICTA

For local development I used Wamp64 in conjuction with Wordpress and Wordpress plugins.

Notice: @functions.php I rearranged the hooks to fit the styling needs of my client (https://www.vapebuds.co) and called add/remove hooks in single-product.php for single vs variable products.

Lastly, I used a custom css to edit most of the Woocommerce styles.
